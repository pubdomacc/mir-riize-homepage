## RIIZE MIR Mini-Project

This is my music-information-retrieval analysis project.
More content coming soon.


## Disclaimer
This project is a personal, non-commercial study created for educational purposes while learning Music Information Retrieval (MIR). All rights to the original music, recordings, and related materials belong to their respective copyright holders, including SM Entertainment.
Only analytical outputs—such as plots, spectrograms, and extracted features—are shared here. The original audio is not distributed, and no part of the copyrighted work is reproduced in a way that allows reconstruction of the recording.
If any rights holders request changes or removal, I will address them promptly.
