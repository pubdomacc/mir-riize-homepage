# MIR Analysis of a RIIZE Song from Fame Album

This mini-project explores the musical structure of a RIIZE track using basic music-information-retrieval (MIR) tools.  
The goal is simple: break down rhythm, energy, and pitch patterns through a set of lightweight audio features.

The analysis was done in a Jupyter notebook.
